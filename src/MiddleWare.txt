1.Middleware are teh functions which are called after client makes a request  to server.
2.These functions basically handles request , response before reaching the route handlers.
3.Used: -
- to modify request and response
- to call next Middleware
- end request response cycle
4.Middleware are executed in the order they are defined
-- Perform tasks like : Authentication, logging or error handling
5.These provide Separation concepts and manage complex routes efficiently.

How Middleware Works in Express.js?
In Express.js, middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are added to the application. Hereâ€™s how the typical flow works:

Request arrives at the server.
Middleware functions are applied to the request, one by one.
Each middleware can either:
Send a response and end the request-response cycle.
Call next() to pass control to the next middleware.
If no middleware ends the cycle, the route handler is reached, and a final response is sent.

 app.use('/user',(req,res) =>{
    console.log('Middleware')
    next();
 },
 (req,res) =>{
    res.send('Data sent')
 })
